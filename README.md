# FIFA-Optimal-Team-Selection-Using-AI-Algorithms-in-FifaUltimateTeam
This project uses AI algorithms to determine the best possible team in the FIFA game. Two different approaches are implemented.

1.Genetic Algorithm: A bio-inspired optimization technique to evolve teams over generations to achieve the optimal squad.
2.Hill Climbing Algorithm: A heuristic search algorithm that iteratively improves the team by making small changes to reach the best possible configuration.

Both algorithms are implemented in Python and aim to find the most effective team based on player attributes and overall performance.

# Features:
-->Uses Genetic Algorithm to simulate natural selection and evolve the best team.
-->Implements Hill Climbing Algorithm to optimize team composition step-by-step.
-->Works with player statistics to maximize team potential in FIFA.

# Technologies:
-->Python: For implementing the AI algorithms.

# Usage:
1.Clone this repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/eraygokcee/FIFA-Optimal-Team-Selection-Using-AI-Algorithms.git

2.Install the required dependencies
```bash
pip install pandas

3.Run the algorithms:
Genetic Algorithm:
